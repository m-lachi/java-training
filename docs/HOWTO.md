The master branch lists all units in the repository. Each unit has it's own branch named `unit/<unit number>` and deals with a single feature or aspect of the application or its design. The starting commit of the unit is tagged as `<unit number>-start`, the final commit is tagged as `<unit number>-end`.<br> To start working through a unit simply branch out your own branch based on the start commit of the desired unit's branch and start with the todo's described below. To validate your work compare your branch with the end commit of the unit.
